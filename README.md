Blackjack Game


This app is (up until now) the most complex I've 'built'. Again, it's mostly built with help and instructions from the same videos as first two projects. Namely: JavaScript Programming - Full Course (https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M). Veeery slowly, but surely, I can say that JavaScript (and HTML and CSS) is growing on me and it's getting a bit easier for me to write. Far from where I'd like to be, but it's a good beginning. All thanks to the amazing teacher that is Per Harald Borgen.

Can't wait for the next project!
